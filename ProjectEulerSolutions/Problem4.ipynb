    "Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thought Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the largest palindrome made from the product of two three-digit numbers, one could iterate through all possible combinations of 3 digit numbers, create string representations of the product of each combination, and check if the string representation of the product is a palindrome, and then only store palindromes found that are larger than the previous one found. At the end of this iterative process, the largest palindrome made from the product of two three-digit numbers would have been found.\n",
