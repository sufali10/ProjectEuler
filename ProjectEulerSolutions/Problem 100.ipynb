    "## Initial thoughts: \n",
    "\n",
    "Denote the number of blue discs as $b$ and the total number of discs as $T$, then we have the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{2}$ = $\\frac{b(b-1)}{T (T-1)}  : (1)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore b^2 - b - \\frac{T(T-1)}{2} = 0  : (2)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore b = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+2T(T-1)}}{2}  : (3)$  \n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can perhaps try a brute force approach where we try to iterate through values of $ T > 10^{12}$ and find the first integer solution. However, upon trying this my computer was crashing as there were too many iterations to go through, so I quickly realised the brute force solution is definitely not a viable solution. \n",
    "## After further reading\n",
    "After some reading on google on trying to methods of finding integer solutions to quadratic functions, I came across diophantine equations for the first time, specifically Pell's equation and it's recurrence relation solution. Therefore, I decided to transform $(2)$ into a form equivalent to Pell's equation, given by the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "$b^2 - b - \\frac{T(T-1)}{2} = 0 \\implies 2(b-\\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{4} = (T- \\frac{1}{2})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\frac{u}{2} = b - \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{v}{2} = T - \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore v^2 - 2u^2 = -1 : (4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore (v + u\\sqrt{2})(v - u\\sqrt{2}) = -1 : (5)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation $(4)$ is the negative Pell's equation with $D=2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental solution of $(4)$ can be observed to be given by $(v_f,u_f) = (1,1)$ and since equation $(4)$ is an negative Pell's equation, the integer solutions of $(4)$ are generated using the following recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_n + u_n\\sqrt{2} = (v_f+u_f\\sqrt{2})^{2n+1}: n \\in \\mathbb{N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. $v_n + u_n\\sqrt{2} = (1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore v_{n+1} + u_{n+1}\\sqrt{2} = (1+\\sqrt{2})^{2(n+1)+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore v_{n+1} + u_{n+1}\\sqrt{2} = (1+\\sqrt{2})^{2n+1} (1+\\sqrt{2})^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore v_{n+1} + u_{n+1}\\sqrt{2} = (v_n + u_n\\sqrt{2})(3+2\\sqrt{2})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore v_{n+1} + u_{n+1}\\sqrt{2} = (3v_n + 4u_n) + (2v_n + 3u_n)\\sqrt{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore v_{n+1} = 3v_{n} + 4u_{n}, u_{n+1} = 2v_{n} + 3u_{n}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Now finally relating this back to the number of blue discs, $b$, and the total number of disks, $T$, we firstly have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$b_{n+1} = \\frac{u_{n+1}+1}{2}, T_{n+1} = \\frac{v_{n+1}+1}{2}$ and $u_n = 2b_n - 1, v_n = 2T_n - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore b_{n+1} = \\frac{2(2T_n - 1) + 3(2b_n - 1) + 1}{2}, T_{n+1} = \\frac{3(2T_n -1) + 4(2b_n -1) + 1}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore b_{n+1} = 3b_n + 2T_n - 2, T_{n+1} = 4b_n + 3T_n -3$\n",
    "\n",
    "So now the recurrence relations for generating the integer solutions of $(2)$ have been obtained and thus we can obtain the solution to the problem by starting from the fundamental solution which is $(b_f,T_f)=(3,4)$\n",

    "I had no prior experience with diophantine equations, so this problem was challenging in determining the correct course of action on how to obtain integer solutions of equation $(2)$, however after reading up on Pell's equations the path to the solution became a lot more clear. In particular, a big difficulty I faced was figuring out how one should transform equation $(2)$ into Pell's equation. But I really enjoyed the further reading I had to do and the algebraic challenges this question provided, my intuition and understanding about quadratic equations has been improved. I look forward to solving more similar problems. "
