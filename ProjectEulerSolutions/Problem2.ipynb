    "A brute force solution could be to make a list of all of the terms in the Fibonacci sequence below four million and then sum only the even valued terms. The brute force solution will be inefficient due to memory usage and a non-optimal time complexity (of **O(2n)**). To make this efficient, one could only keep a list of the last two terms in the fibonacci sequence since they are only relevent to obtain the next term. This will then allow one to add each of the even-valued terms as one goes along the Fibonacci sequence, therefore minimising memeory usage and the time complexity of the solution being reduced to **O(n)**. \n",

    "Also an additional challenge would be to find the function that returns the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence below $ N : N \\in \\mathbb{N}\\ , N \\geq 2 $ \n",
