# ProjectEuler

## Overview 

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook files I have created to document my solutions, computed in Python, to the Project Euler problem sets. Each file corresponds to one problem and includes the problem statement, an outline of my thought process in determining the solution, and the solution itself.

Additionally, some notebooks include generalised extensions of the original problems. In these extensions, I provide a revised problem statement, my thought process in determining the generalised solution, the generalised solution, the application of the general solution to the original problem, and various other particular solutions.

## Invitation for Feedback and Extensions

I am happy to receive feedback to improve my documentation, solutions or code clarity, and would be keen to discuss further extensions of the problems as I like to take on myself where it seems appropriate.
