# ProjectEuler

## Purpose

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook files I have created to document my solutions, computed in Python, to the Project Euler problem sets. Each file corresponds to one problem and contains the problem statement, an outline of my thought process in determining the solution, followed by my solution.

## Table of Contents

| Problem Number | Title                          | Link                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Problem 1      | Multiples of 3 and 5           | [Problem 1](ProjectEulerSolutions/Problem1.ipynb) |

## Invitation for Feedback and Extensions

I am happy to receive feedback to improve my documentation, solutions or code clarity, and would be keen to discuss further extensions of the problems as I like to take on myself where it seems appropriate.
